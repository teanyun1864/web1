  <p>
    Cascading Style Sheets , or Cascading Style Sheets ( Cascading Style
    Sheets , CSS) is a markup language, a language that describes
    how the actual display [1] , HTML and XHTML mainly used in, XML can be
    used in. It is a standard of the W3C and has a high degree of freedom
    when defining layouts and styles.
    If the markup language (ex. HTML) is in charge of the body of the website,
    CSS can be said to be in charge of decorating clothes and accessories.
    In other words, you can decorate like a completely different website
    by changing the CSS file while leaving the HTML structure as it is.
    In the case of CSS3, which is currently under development , a function
    to replace images created with graphic editing programs such as shadow effects,
    gradients, and transformations has been added. Also, various animation
    functions have been added to some extent replace Adobe Flash .
